There was mock fire drill in the office. All were standing in the evacuation area. 
The Instructor asked “So what is the first thing you will do in case of fire?” 
A new joiner from the crowd said “Get down fast using stairs“ Instructor said “Yes! Always use the stairs.” 
One person from the crowd then shouted “But our office doesn’t have any stairs as we have only ground floor” 
The instructor looked at the founder and said “You must have stairs!” 
The auditor noted this as an area of improvement. 

It’s been 3 years since this & in every internal audit we explain why this point is not getting closed.
